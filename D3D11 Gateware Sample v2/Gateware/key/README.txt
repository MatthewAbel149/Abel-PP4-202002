The files in the "key" folder are utility classes used by Gateware and some dependent projects.
The "key" folder can be considered a companion folder to the Gateware project.
It contains many wrappers and helpers that lie outside of Gateware's own interface and platfrom restrictions.
You are in no way required to use the items within directly.
Basically if Gateware requires a utility header that we feel will be useful directly to the end user as well we keep it here.

Many come from various sources I have created/used throughout the years.

Each file is independently licensed and does not conform to any gateware interface or quality standards.

That is not to say many of these files are not of high quality. 

Some of them such as the templated containers are used in commercial production code to this very day.

All software in this folder comes with no garuntees and are to be used at your own risk.
Basically I make no promises so don't sue me if there is a bug or something.
